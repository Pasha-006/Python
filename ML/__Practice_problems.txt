########################### 
Student Scores Dataset

Problem: Predict exam scores based on the number of hours studied.
Source: Student Scores Dataset
Why Easy: A single feature (hours studied) makes this problem straightforward.
Car Prices Dataset

Problem: Predict car prices based on the carâ€™s age, mileage, and engine type.
Source: Kaggle - Car Prices
Why Easy: A simple problem with a few numerical features.
Insurance Dataset

Problem: Predict insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.
Source: Insurance Dataset
Why Easy: It involves simple numeric and categorical features for predicting a continuous value.
Intermediate Level
Boston Housing Dataset

Problem: Predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to employment centers.
Source: Available in sklearn.datasets (deprecated for ethical reasons, use alternatives like California Housing).
Why Intermediate: It involves multiple features and some need for feature normalization.
Auto MPG Dataset

Problem: Predict miles per gallon (MPG) of cars based on features like horsepower, weight, and acceleration.
Source: Auto MPG Dataset
Why Intermediate: Contains mixed numeric and categorical variables, and some feature engineering is required.
California Housing Dataset

Problem: Predict the median house price based on latitude, longitude, average rooms, and more.
Source: California Housing Dataset
Why Intermediate: A larger dataset with more features and requires normalization.
Moderate Level
Energy Efficiency Dataset

Problem: Predict the heating load and cooling load of buildings based on various building features.
Source: Energy Efficiency Dataset
Why Moderate: It has many features and requires data preprocessing, feature scaling, and handling of missing values.
Bike Sharing Dataset

Problem: Predict the number of bike rentals based on weather conditions, temperature, and time of year.
Source: Bike Sharing Dataset
Why Moderate: Contains time-series and weather data that may require feature engineering and transformation.
Advertising Dataset

Problem: Predict sales based on advertising budgets in different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper).
Source: Advertising Dataset
Why Moderate: Involves multivariable regression and may require some feature analysis.
Diabetes Dataset

Problem: Predict the progression of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
Source: Diabetes Dataset in sklearn
Why Moderate: It involves multiple features with continuous values, and there's a need for some data scaling.

How to Use These Datasets
Download the datasets from their respective sources or use libraries like pandas or sklearn for pre-built datasets.
Start with exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify correlations, and preprocess the data.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, and apply regression techniques such as linear regression, ridge, or lasso.
