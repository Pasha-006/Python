Feature	List Comprehension	map()
Return Type	Always returns a list.	        Returns a map object (an iterator),                                                  which can be converted to a list.
Syntax	                                    More flexible and readable, especially with filtering.	                             Requires a function (or lambda) to apply to each item.
Performance	Typically faster in small data sets as it avoids function calls overhead.	Lazy evaluation: more memory efficient for large datasets because of lazy evaluation.
Function Requirement	No function is needed; any expression can be used in the comprehension.	Requires a function (built-in or custom) to apply to each element.
Multiple Iterables	Can be done with nested comprehensions, though more complex.	Can operate on multiple iterables simultaneously (pairwise application).
Flexibility	Can include conditions for filtering elements.	No filtering; strictly applies the function to each element.
Readability	More readable for most people, especially for simple transformations.	Less readable, particularly with more complex lambdas.
